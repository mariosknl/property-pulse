# Section Intro

In this version of the course, we used API routes to fetch data from the server. Then we hit those API routes from our components. This is an ok way to do things, but it is not utilizing the capability of Next.js. We are doing things in a MERN type of way. We can actually cut out most of the API routes by fetching the data right from the server components.

I decided that I am going to redo the course in the coming months and refactor the server and client components to be more Next.js native. This will make the course more efficient and easier to understand.

Another thing we will do is use form actions as opposed to using the `useState` hook in the components and submitting to API routes. This will make the code cleaner and more organized as well.

For now, I have added the next 2 sections in the docs to show you how to refactor. There is also a branch called `refactor` in the repo at https://github.com/bradtraversy/property-pulse/tree/refactor. you can see the final code there.

The current version of the course is totally fine in terms of functionality and you can continue with it. I just wanted to let you know that I will be refactoring it in the future. The current version will still be available as well. i will create a download link for it so you can continue with it if you like.

I understand that following these docs is not going to be as clear as watching the course. I will try and get the new version up asap. Thanks for your patience and understanding.
